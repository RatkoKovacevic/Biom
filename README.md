HulkApps Front-End Developer Practical Test

-Tech stack used including specific libraries / versions.
I used basic HTML CSS and vanilla javascript to showcase that I am comfortable with the basics. 

-A quick paragraph with how you approached the project, what you liked, what you didnâ€™t like, and where you faced issues.

I usually start like the web page itself from the top to the bottom. The easy bits first so I can do more work. 
I liked the project I love when websites have a lot of animation it gives so much life and dynamic to the site.
What I loved was that I had to use Photoshop to make adjustments to the picture "Vessel Color Section" had to remove the gray bottom of the picture.

What I didn't like is that I hadn't had more time to finish the project. I am really sorry that I have to go next week to a seminar and 
I don't have the time to finish the project. 

-Estimated time to complete your test.

4 days about 4-6 hours per day
